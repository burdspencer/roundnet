This information system uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and SQL to store and display information about the member base of the Roundnet Club at Western Michigan University. The home page of the site displays upcoming matches and recent results. The 'Players' page allows administrators to add new members to the database, and delete specific records if desired. The 'Forms' page allows administrators (both Club and WMU) to download and upload concussion and safe driver forms, which are both required for membership.
